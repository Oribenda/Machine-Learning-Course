## HW1 - Linear Regression

This folder contains my solutions and implementations for Homework 1, which focuses on Linear Regression. It includes the following components:

- Single Variable Linear Regression
- Gradient Descent
- Pseudoinverse
- Forward Feature Selection
- Multivariate Linear Regression

---

## HW2 - Decision Trees

In Homework 2, I worked on Decision Trees. This folder includes:

- Gini Impurity
- Entropy Value
- Goodness of Split
- Depth Pruning
- Chi Pruning

---

## HW3 - MAP Classifier

Homework 3 is centered around the MAP Classifier. It comprises:

- Maximum Likelihood Estimation
- Normal Naive Bayes Classifier
- Full Bayes Classifier

---

## HW4 - Logistic Regression, Bayes, and EM

The fourth assignment delves into Logistic Regression, Bayes, and EM. It encompasses:

- Cross-Validation
- Normal Distribution PDF
- Expectation Maximization
- GMM (Gaussian Mixture Model)
- Naive Bayes
- Model Evaluation

---

## HW5 - Clustering - k-means

The fifth and final homework assignment focuses on Clustering with k-means.
